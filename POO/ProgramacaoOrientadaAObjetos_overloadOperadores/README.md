# Operator Overloading
```diff 
+ Overload operators example in C++: operations between rational numbers 
 ```

In this project was implemented a class named ```Racional``` (Rational) composed of two integers: ```numerador``` (numerator) and ```denominador``` (denominator). Then there are a few operators that are overloaded so the algorithm can calculte additions, subtractions, multiplications and divisions between rational numbers. Futhermore, some relational operatores are also overloaded.


Mathematical operations:
```
Addition +
Subtraction -
Multiplication *
Divisions /
```
Relational operators:
```
Greater than >
Greater than or Equal to >=
Less Than <
Less Than or Equal to <=
Equal to ==
Not Equal to !=
```
